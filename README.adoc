== FTL Overview

FTL, *Finish The Labs*, is currently a student invoked automated lab grading system
designed to allow students to self mark their *OPENTLC* labs to see if they
have passed them correctly. Other uses include lab and lab environment validation.



On *failure* it highlights the failed sections via Instructor supplied  error
messages. Students have unlimited attempts and can run the grading at any time,
without penalty.

On *success* it:

. Informs the student
. Updates the LMS (at this point the `grade-update-lms` role is a stub

=== Terminology

A small number of terms are defined below

* *grader host* - Host that the student works from, typically bastion or workstation
* *graders* - Graders are playbooks that grade a lab, they are typically invoked via the `grade_lab` command which is installed at deployment time.
* *solvers* - Solvers are playbooks that solver labs i.e. they apply all the necessary ansible tasks to move complete a lab.
* *convenience roles* - Convenience roles, in the `roles` directory provide pre-built roles for testing specfic, and common, scenarios e.g.
** ftl_check_command_output
** ftl_check_file_exists
** ftl_check_ocp_svc_exists
** ftl_check_service_enabled
** ftl_check_service_started
** ftl_check_user_exists

=== Workflow - Deployment

FTL can be deployed via push i.e. inserted into a lab at the deployment
stage. An obvious example being inserted via Ansible Agnostic Deployer in the
Post Software stage of a config.

NOTE: FTL currently clones the entire repo i.e all tests for all labs so no
additional meta data needs to be supplied at deployment time.

Alternatively it could be modified to be deployed via pull i.e. the student
clones the FTL repo locally. This will require either a permissions change on
the repo or a API token/login to be provided as FTL is a private repo today.

=== Workflow - Developing a Lab Test


Instructors create a series of lab checking playbooks in the correct sub-directory
of the `courses` directory. Tests are written in `ansible` and test 1 or more
conditions in the lab. For example:

* Has package `foo` been installed
* Does user `bar` exist
* Does a file contain a certain line
* Does a URI give a certain response e.g. *200* or a certain output

Whilst instructors can create tests some convenience roles have been created
to both test condition and to track score, these are detailed in the
link:docs/FTL_Deployer_Guide.adoc[Lab Grading Author Guide*]

.Sample of a typical lab test leveraging an existing role
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Section 1.5, Check student has installed ansible
  role: opentlc_package_installed
  vars:
    section_number: 1.5
    student_error_message: Package not installed
    package: ansible
----

Instructors can author custom, and more complex, tests as long as these can be
executed in an ansible playbook. See the Documentation for more details.

== Usage

Students are supplied with `grade_lab` and `solve_lab` wrapper scripts, in /usr/local/bin that _typically_ take 2 arguments, course name and lab number:


`$ grade_lab ansible_engine_foundations 03_01`

== Questions:

. Do students invoke the check via:
** `CLI` on the lab machine
** Via button in the LMS
. Does the check action pull in the playbook(s) or are they already there?
** i.e. backed in at lab build time
