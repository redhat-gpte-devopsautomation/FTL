== Overview: Grader Roles

In the FTL root `roles` directory a number of *grader roles * have been provided. These test common scenarios and are designed to allow grader playbooks for labs to be written easily and simply.

Grader roles include their own logging so a simple lab grader can simply call 1 or more grader roles in sequence to grade a lab.

=== Example grader roles
grader_check_file_exists
grader_check_ocp_node_exists
grader_check_ocp_route_exists
grader_check_ocp_svc_exists
grader_check_package_installed
grader_check_service_enabled
grader_check_service_started
grader_check_uri_response
grader_check_user_does_not_exist
grader_check_user_exists

=== Simple Walk Through

In the sample below 2 convenience roles are called using a common pattern

- name: Grade lab 03 01 of Ansible Engine Foundations
  hosts: web
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  roles:      # All lab tests go here

    - name: Section 6.4.1, Check student has installed Apache
      role: grader_check_package_installed
      vars:
        task_description_message: Install Apache, httpd, package
        package: httpd

    - name: Section 6.4.2, Check student has running Apache
      role: grader_check_service_started
      vars:
        task_description_message: Start Apache, httpd, Service
        service: httpd

    - name: Section 6.4.3, Check student has enabled Apache
      role: grader_check_service_enabled
      vars:
        task_description_message: Enable Apache, httpd, at boot

== Overview

FTL (Finish the Labs) provides a platform to both grade and solve student labs. In addition it provides hooks to update the students results to the LMS. This guide covers the topic of how to create a series of lab grading playbooks for a course.

Before we look at creating *grading* playbooks it is valuable to understand the typical workflow of a student grading a lab.

=== Student Workflow

On completion of a lab the student will copy and paste the lab checking command which will wrap the `lab_grading` playbook which will:

[source,bash]
----
$ grade ansible_engine_foundations lab_03_01
----

. Initialize any reporting data structures it needs to
. Execute the instructor created grading playbook(s) and associated roles (if any)
. Report the students progress highlighting failed steps
. Updates the LMS in the case of the student passing the lab

Only Step 2 requires

NOTE: In version 1.0 no attempt is made to generate a score. A student either passes or fails.

This guide focusses on Step 2 and how to successfully create grading and solving playbooks

* *grading* playbooks: checks a students work by validating key steps have been completed
* *solver* playbooks: solves an entire lab
** Can be called sequentially i.e. each lab in a course, to validate a lab infrastructure is valid

=== Instructor Workflow
.Creating grading and solving playbooks


Identify the key tasks to validate in a student lab. In a lab of any complexity it can be considered a good practice to check at multiple stages the students progress. Just testing the final stage or end result, for example testing a URI for an expected response doesn't allow detailed feedback to the student.

Test critical stages.



TIP: Whilst a complex lab may be easy to test by the response for say the final application, upon student failure

=== Structure

At the root level of the FTL repo the directory `courses/` is used to hold each course in a course directory. *All* course grading content including lab specific roles should be encapsulated in your course directory which you can create here.. _(For those familair with link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible[Ansible Agnostic Deployer] this pattern is similar to its `configs`)_

Each *course* directory e.g. `courses/ansible_engine_foundations/` contains all playbooks, metadata (e.g. inventory files, lab sepocfic roles etc), and sub directories for each lab.
